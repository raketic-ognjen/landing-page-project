# landing-page-project
I did project for the Odin Project.

Here is what I did yesterday and which technologies I used:
I did from top to bottom landing page
    * Make Header Area and links to other subpages
    * Make Circle area for picture and use Baskervvile font as a main font for this page
    * Storyline with pictures about my life
    * Motivational quote from Alexandre Dummas
    * Footer.

I used 4 Different Colors:
    * Background color for body - #75a5c4
    * For Hero Area - Main color #232C31 and Second color #CA5834
    * For Motivational Quote
